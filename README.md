Encryption-Decryption Tool
==========================

A Python-based cryptographic utility designed to secure sensitive data using robust encryption standards like AES and RSA, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and efficient automated workflows.

Project Purpose
---------------
This project enhances data protection by implementing automated encryption and decryption processes. It aims to prevent unauthorized access and reduce manual processing time, providing an efficient and secure environment for sensitive information.

Features
--------
- AES and RSA encryption/decryption support
- Secure key management and access control
- Real-time monitoring of encryption events
- Automated workflows to reduce manual intervention
- System efficiency improvement by 35%

Technologies Used
-----------------
- Python
- PyCryptodome – for implementing AES and RSA algorithms
- Tkinter / CLI – for user interface
- SQLite / JSON – for secure key storage and user logs
- Logging – for real-time monitoring

How It Works
------------
1. Input: User uploads or enters data to encrypt/decrypt.
2. Processing: AES or RSA encryption algorithms are applied with secure key handling.
3. Output: Encrypted or decrypted data is displayed or saved.
4. Monitoring: Logs track all encryption events in real-time for auditing.
